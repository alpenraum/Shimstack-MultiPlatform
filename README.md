Multiplatform continuation of [Shimstack](https://www.github.com/alpenraum/shimstack)

# Shimstack
This is sandbox / passion project for me to try out ideas, improve my skills, and (hopefully) some day to publish.

## Architecture
This project is based on Google's best practice for both Architecture and modularization found in [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).

(the more I work with this the less happy I am. It is difficult to reach a proper separation of concerns)


## The rest is WIP
